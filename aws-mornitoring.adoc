## Monitoring in AWS
• AWS CloudWatch:
    • Metrics: Collect and track key metrics
    • Logs: Collect, monitor, analyze and store log files
    • Events: Send notifications when certain events happen in your AWS 
    • Alarms: React in real-time to metrics / events

• AWS X-Ray:
    • Troubleshooting application performance and errors 
    • Distributed tracing of microservices

• AWS CloudTrail:
    • Internal monitoring of API calls being made
    • Audit changes to AWS Resources by your users

## AWS CloudWatch Metrics
• CloudWatch provides metrics for every services in AWS
• Metric is a variable to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn...)
• Metrics belong to namespaces
• Dimension is an attribute of a metric (instance id, environment, etc...). 
• Up to 10 dimensions per metric
• Metrics have timestamps
• Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics

## AWS CloudWatch EC2 Detailed monitoring
• EC2 instance metrics have metrics “every 5 minutes”
• With detailed monitoring (for a cost), you get data “every 1 minute”
• Use detailed monitoring if you want to more prompt scale your ASG!
• The AWS Free Tier allows us to have 10 detailed monitoring metrics
• Note: EC2 Memory usage is by default not pushed (must be pushed from inside the instance as a custom metric)

## AWS CloudWatch Custom Metrics
• Possibility to define and send your own custom metrics to CloudWatch
• Ability to use dimensions (attributes) to segment metrics • Instance.id
• Environment.name
• Metric resolution (StorageResolution API parameter – two possible value): • Standard: 1 minute (60 seconds)
• High Resolution: 1 second – Higher cost
• Use API call PutMetricData
• Use exponential back off in case of throttle errors

## AWS CloudWatch Alarms
• Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric
• Alarms can go to Auto Scaling, EC2 Actions, SNS notifications 
• Various options (sampling, %, max, min, etc...)
• Alarm States: 
    • OK
    • INSUFFICIENT_DATA 
    • ALARM
• Period:
    • Length of time in seconds to evaluate the metric
    • High resolution custom metrics: can only choose 10 sec or 30 sec

## AWS CloudWatch Logs
• Applications can send logs to CloudWatch using the SDK
• CloudWatch can collect log from:
    • Elastic Beanstalk: collection of logs from application
    • ECS: collection from containers
    • AWS Lambda: collection from function logs
    • VPC Flow Logs:VPC specific logs
    • API Gateway
    • CloudTrail based on filter
    • CloudWatch log agents: for example on EC2 machines • Route53: Log DNS queries
• CloudWatch Logs can go to:
    • Batch exporter to S3 for archival
    • Stream to ElasticSearch cluster for further analytics

• CloudWatch Logs can use filter expressions
• Logs storage architecture:
    • Log groups: arbitrary name, usually representing an application 
    • Log stream: instances within application / log files / containers
• Can define log expiration policies (never expire, 30 days, etc..)
• Using the AWS CLI we can tail CloudWatch logs
• To send logs to CloudWatch, make sure IAM permissions are correct! 
• Security: encryption of logs using KMS at the Group Level

## CloudWatch Logs for EC2
• By default, no logs from your EC2 machine will go to CloudWatch
• You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want
• Make sure IAM permissions are correct
• The CloudWatch log agent can be setup on-premises too

## CloudWatch Logs Agent & Unified Agent 
• For virtual servers (EC2 instances, on-premise servers...)

• CloudWatch Logs Agent
    • Old version of the agent
    • Can only send to CloudWatch Logs

• CloudWatch Unified Agent
    • Collect additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes, etc...
    • Collect logs to send to CloudWatch Logs
    • Centralized configuration using SSM Parameter Store

## CloudWatch Unified Agent – Metrics • Collected directly on your Linux server / EC2 instance
• CPU (active, guest, idle, system, user, steal)
• Disk metrics (free, used, total), Disk IO (writes, reads, bytes, iops)
• RAM (free, inactive, used, total, cached)
• Netstat (number of TCP and UDP connections, net packets, bytes) • Processes (total, dead, bloqued, idle, running, sleep)
• Swap Space (free, used, used %)
• Reminder: out-of-the box metrics for EC2 – disk, CPU, network (high level)

## CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter
• CloudWatch Logs can use filter expressions 
• For example, find a specific IP inside of a log
• Or count occurrences of “ERROR” in your logs 
• Metric filters can be used to trigger alarms
*• Filters do not retroactively filter data. Filters only publish the metric data points for events that happen after the filter was created.*

## AWS CloudWatch Events
• Schedule: Cron jobs
• Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something 
• Ex: CodePipeline state changes!
• Triggers to Lambda functions, SQS/SNS/Kinesis Messages
• CloudWatch Event creates a small JSON document to give information
about the change

## Amazon EventBridge
• EventBridge is the next evolution of CloudWatch Events
• Default event bus: generated by AWS services (CloudWatch Events)
• Partner event bus: receive events from SaaS service or applications (Zendesk, DataDog, Segment, Auth0...)
• Custom Event buses: for your own applications
• Event buses can be accessed by other AWS accounts
• Rules: how to process the events (similar to CloudWatch Events)

## Amazon EventBridge Schema Registry
• EventBridge can analyze the events in
your bus and infer the schema
• The Schema Registry allows you to generate code for your application, that will know in advance how data is structured in the event bus
• Schema can be versioned

## Amazon EventBridge vs CloudWatch Events
• Amazon EventBridge builds upon and extends CloudWatch Events.
• It uses the same service API and endpoint, and the same underlying service infrastructure.
• EventBridge allows extension to add event buses for your custom applications and your third-party SaaS apps.
• Event Bridge has the Schema Registry capability
• EventBridge has a different name to mark the new capabilities
• Over time, the CloudWatch Events name will be replaced with EventBridge.

## AWS X-Ray advantages
• Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks)
• Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture • Pinpoint service issues
• Review request behavior
• Find errors and exceptions
• Are we meeting time SLA?
• Where I am throttled?
• Identify users that are impacted

## X-Ray compatibility
• AWS Lambda
• Elastic Beanstalk
• ECS
• ELB
• API Gateway
• EC2 Instances or any application server (even on premise)

## AWS X-Ray Leverages Tracing
• Tracing is an end to end way to following a “request”
• Each component dealing with the request adds its own “trace”
• Tracing is made of segments (+ sub segments)
• Annotations can be added to traces to provide extra-information
• Ability to trace:
    • Every request
    • Sample request (as a % for example or a rate per minute)
• X-Ray Security:
    • IAM for authorization
    • KMS for encryption at rest

## AWS X-Ray How to enable it?

I)Your code (Java, Python, Go, Node.js, .NET) must import the AWS X-Ray SDK
• Very little code modification needed
• The application SDK will then capture:
    • Calls to AWS services
    • HTTP / HTTPS requests
    • Database Calls (MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB)
    • Queue calls (SQS)
2) Install the X-Ray daemon or enable X-Ray AWS Integration
• X-Ray daemon works as a low level UDP packet interceptor (Linux / Windows / Mac...)
• AWS Lambda / other AWS services already run the X-Ray daemon for you
• Each application must have the IAM rights to write data to X-Ray

## The X-Ray magic
• X-Ray service collects data from all the different services
• Service map is computed from all the segments and traces
• X-Ray is graphical, so even non technical people can help troubleshoot

## AWS X-Ray Troubleshooting
• If X-Ray is not working on EC2
    • Ensure the EC2 IAM Role has the proper permissions 
    • Ensure the EC2 instance is running the X-Ray Daemon

• To enable on AWS Lambda:
    • Ensure it has an IAM execution role with proper policy
    (AWSX-RayWriteOnlyAccess)
    • Ensure that X-Ray is imported in the code

## X-Ray Instrumentation in your code
• Instrumentation means the measure of product’s performance, diagnose errors, and to write trace information.
• To instrument your application code, you use the X-Ray SDK
• Many SDK require only configuration changes
• You can modify your application code to customize and annotation the data that the SDK sends to X- Ray, using interceptors, filters, handlers, middleware...

## X-Ray Concepts
• Segments: each application / service will send them
• Subsegments: if you need more details in your segment
• Trace: segments collected together to form an end-to-end trace
• Sampling: decrease the amount of requests sent to X-Ray, reduce cost 
• Annotations: Key Value pairs used to index traces and use with filters 
• Metadata: Key Value pairs, not indexed, not used for searching
• The X-Ray daemon / agent has a config to send traces cross account: 
    • make sure the IAM permissions are correct – the agent will assume the role
    • This allows to have a central account for all your application tracing

## X-Ray Sampling Rules
• With sampling rules, you control the amount of data that you record
• You can modify sampling rules without changing your code
• By default, the X-Ray SDK records the first request each second, and five percent of any additional requests.
• One request per second is the reservoir, which ensures that at least one trace is recorded each second as long the service is serving requests.
• Five percent is the rate at which additional requests beyond the reservoir size are sampled.

## X-Ray Write APIs (used by the X-Ray daemon)
• PutTraceSegments: Uploads segment documents to AWS X-Ray
• PutTelemetryRecords: Used by the AWS X-Ray daemon to upload telemetry.
• SegmentsReceivedCount, SegmentsRejectedCounts, BackendConnectionErrors...
• GetSamplingRules: Retrieve all sampling rules (to know what/when to send)
• GetSamplingTargets & GetSamplingStatisticSummaries: advanced
• The X-Ray daemon needs to have an IAM policy authorizing the correct API calls to function correctly

## X-Ray Read APIs
• GetServiceGraph: main graph
• BatchGetTraces: Retrieves a list of traces specified by ID. Each trace is a collection of segment documents that originates from a single request.
• GetTraceSummaries: Retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified time frame using an optional filter.To get the full traces, pass the trace IDs to BatchGetTraces.
• GetTraceGraph: Retrieves a service graph for one or more specific trace IDs.

## X-Ray with Elastic Beanstalk
• AWS Elastic Beanstalk platforms include the X-Ray daemon
 • You can run the daemon by setting an option in the Elastic Beanstalk console or with a configuration file (in .ebextensions/xray-daemon.config)

 Make sure to give your instance profile the correct IAM permissions so that the X-Ray daemon can function correctly
• Then make sure your application code is instrumented with the X-Ray SDK
• Note: *The X-Ray daemon is not provided for Multicontainer Docker*

## AWS CloudTrail
• Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
• CloudTrail is enabled by default!
• Get an history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account by: 
    • Console
    • SDK
    • CLI
    • AWS Services
• Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
• *A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region.* • If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!

## CloudTrail Events
• *Management Events*:
    • Operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account
    • Examples:
    • Configuring security (IAM AttachRolePolicy)
    • Configuring rules for routing data (Amazon EC2 CreateSubnet)
    • Setting up logging (AWS CloudTrail CreateTrail)
    • By default, trails are configured to log management events.
    • Can separate Read Events (that don’t modify resources) from Write Events (that may modify resources)
• *Data Events*:
    • By default, data events are not logged (because high volume operations)
    • Amazon S3 object-level activity (ex: GetObject, DeleteObject, PutObject): can separate Read and Write Events
    • AWS Lambda function execution activity (the Invoke API)
• *CloudTrail Insights Events*:
    CloudTrail Insights
        • Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activity in your account: • inaccurate resource provisioning
        • hitting service limits
        • Bursts of AWS IAM actions
        • Gaps in periodic maintenance activity
    • CloudTrail Insights analyzes normal management events to create a baseline
    • And then continuously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns • Anomalies appear in the CloudTrail console
    • Event is sent to Amazon S3
    • An EventBridge event is generated (for automation needs)

## CloudTrail Events Retention 
• Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail
• To keep events beyond this period, log them to S3 and use Athena

## CloudTrail vs CloudWatch vs X-Ray
• *CloudTrail*:
    • Audit API calls made by users / services / AWS console
    • Useful to detect unauthorized calls or root cause of changes
• *CloudWatch*:
    • CloudWatch Metrics over time for monitoring
    • CloudWatch Logs for storing application log
    • CloudWatch Alarms to send notifications in case of unexpected metrics
• *X-Ray*:
    • Automated Trace Analysis & Central Service Map Visualization
    • Latency, Errors and Fault analysis
    • Request tracking across distributed systems
