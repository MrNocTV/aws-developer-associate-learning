## Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways
• Internet Gateways helps our VPC instances connect with the internet
• Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway.
• NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed) allow your instances in your Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private

## Network ACL & Security Groups
• NACL (Network ACL)
• A firewall which controls traffic from and to
subnet
• Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
• Are attached at the Subnet level
• Rules only include IP addresses
• Security Groups
• A firewall that controls traffic to and from an
ENI / an EC2 Instance
• Can have only ALLOW rules
• Rules include IP addresses and other security groups

## VPC Flow Logs
• Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces: 
    • VPC Flow Logs
    • Subnet Flow Logs
    • Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
• Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. Example: 
    • Subnets to internet
    • Subnets to subnets
    • Internet to subnets
• Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc...
• VPC Flow logs data can go to S3 / CloudWatch Logs

## VPC Peering
• Connect two VPC, privately using AWS’ network
• Make them behave as if they were in the same network
• Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
• VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)

## VPC Endpoints
• Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network
• This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
• VPC Endpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB
• VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest

## Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
• Site to Site VPN
    • Connect an on-premises VPN t oAWS
    • The connection is automatically encrypted 
    • Goes over the public internet
• Direct Connect (DX)
    • Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
    • The connection is private, secure and fast
    • Goes over a private network
    • Takes at least a month to establish
• Note: Site-to-site VPN and Direct Connect cannot access VPC endpoints

## LAMP Stack on EC2
• Linux: OS for EC2 instances
• Apache:Web Server that run on Linux (EC2) 
• MySQL: database on RDS
• PHP: Application logic (running on EC2)

• Can add Redis / Memcached (ElastiCache) to include a caching tech 
• To store local application data & software: EBS drive (root)
