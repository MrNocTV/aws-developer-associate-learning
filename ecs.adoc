## Docker Containers Management
• To manage containers, we need a container management platform
• Three choices:
• ECS: Amazon’s own platform
• Fargate: Amazon’s own Serverless platform
• EKS: Amazon’s managed Kubernetes (open source)

## ECS Clusters Overview
• ECS Clusters are logical grouping of EC2 instances
• EC2 instances run the ECS agent (Docker container)
• The ECS agents registers the instance to the ECS cluster
• The EC2 instances run a special AMI, made specifically for ECS

## ECS Task Definitions
• Tasks definitions are metadata in JSON form to tell ECS how to run a Docker Container
• It contains crucial information around:
    • Image Name
    • Port Binding for Container and Host
    • Memory and CPU required
    • Environment variables
    • Networking information
    • IAM Role
    • Logging configuration (ex CloudWatch)

## ECS Service
• ECS Services help define how many tasks should run and how they should be run
• They ensure that the number of tasks desired is running across our fleet of EC2 instances.
• They can be linked to ELB / NLB / ALB if needed

## ECR
• So far we’ve been using Docker images from Docker Hub (public) 
• ECR is a private Docker image repository
• Access is controlled through IAM (permission errors => policy)
• AWS CLI v1 login command (may be asked at the exam)
• $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region eu-west-1)
• AWS CLI v2 login command (newer, may also be asked at the exam - pipe)
• aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-1 | docker login --username AWS -- password-stdin 1234567890.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
• Docker Push & Pull:
• docker push 1234567890.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo:latest
• docker pull 1234567890.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo:latest

## Fargate
• When launching an ECS Cluster, we have to create our EC2 instances • If we need to scale, we need to add EC2 instances
• So we manage infrastructure...
• With Fargate, it’s all Serverless!
• We don’t provision EC2 instances
• We just create task definitions, and AWS will run our containers for us • To scale, just increase the task number. Simple! No more EC2 J

## ECS IAM Roles Deep Dive
• EC2 Instance Profile:
    • Used by the ECS agent
    • Makes API calls to ECS service
    • Send container logs to CloudWatch Logs 
    • Pull Docker image from ECR

• ECSTask Role:
    • Allow each task to have a specific role
    • Use different roles for the different ECS Services you run
    • Task Role is defined in the task definition

## ECSTasks Placement
• When a task of type EC2 is launched, ECS must determine where to place it, with the constraints of CPU, memory, and available port.
• Similarly, when a service scales in, ECS ? needs to determine which task to terminate.
• To assist with this, you can define a task placement strategy and task placement constraints
• Note: this is only for ECS with EC2, not for Fargate

## ECS Task Placement Strategies
• Binpack
    • Place tasks based on the least available
    amount of CPU or memory
    • This minimizes the number of instances in use (cost savings)

• Random
    • Place the task randomly

• Spread
    • Place the task evenly based on
    the specified value
    • Example: instanceId, attribute:ecs.availability-zone

• You can mix them together

## ECS Task Placement Constraints
• distinctInstance: place each task on a different container instance
• memberOf: places task on instances that satisfy an expression 
• Uses the Cluster Query Language (advanced)

## ECS – Service Auto Scaling
• CPU and RAM is tracked in CloudWatch at the ECS service level 
• Target Tracking: target a specific average CloudWatch metric
• Step Scaling: scale based on CloudWatch alarms
• Scheduled Scaling: based on predictable changes

• ECS Service Scaling (task level) ≠ EC2 Auto Scaling (instance level) 
• Fargate Auto Scaling is much easier to setup (because serverless)

## ECS – Cluster Capacity Provider
• A Capacity Provider is used in association with a cluster to determine the infrastructure that a task runs on
    • For ECS and Fargate users, the FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers are added automatically
    • For Amazon ECS on EC2, you need to associate the capacity provider with an auto-scaling group
• When you run a task or a service, you define a capacity provider strategy, to prioritize in which provider to run.
• This allows the capacity provider to automatically provision infrastructure for you

## ECS Data Volumes – EC2 Task Strategies
• The EBS volume is already mounted onto the EC2 instances
• This allows your Docker containers to mount the EBS volume and extend the storage capacity of your task
• Problem: if your task moves from one EC2 instance to another one, it won’t be the same EBS volume and data
• Use cases:
    • Mount a data volume between different containers on the same instance
    • Extend the temporary storage of a task

## ECS Data Volumes – EFS File Systems

• Works for both EC2 Tasks and Fargate tasks
• Ability to mount EFS volumes onto tasks
• Tasks launched in any AZ will be able to share the same data in the EFS volume
• Fargate + EFS = serverless + data storage without managing servers
• Use case: persistent multi-AZ shared storage for your containers

## ECS Data Volumes – Bind Mounts Sharing data between containers
• Works for both EC2 Tasks (using local EC2 instance storage) and Fargate tasks (get 4 GB for volume mounts)
• Useful to share an ephemeral storage between multiple containers part of the same ECS task
• Great for “sidecar” container pattern where the sidecar can be used to send metrics/logs to other destinations (separation of concerns)

## ECS Summary + ExamTips
• ECS is used to run Docker containers and has 3 flavors:
• ECS “Classic”: provision EC2 instances to run containers onto • Fargate: ECS Serverless, no more EC2 to provision
• EKS: Managed Kubernetes by AWS

## ECS Classic
• EC2 instances must be created
• We must configure the file /etc/ecs/ecs.config with the cluster name 
• The EC2 instance must run an ECS agent
• EC2 instances can run multiple containers on the same type:
• You must not specify a host port (only container port)
• You should use an Application Load Balancer with the dynamic port mapping 
• The EC2 instance security group must allow traffic from the ALB on all ports
• ECS tasks can have IAM Roles to execute actions against AWS 
• Security groups operate at the instance level, not task level

## Fargate
• Fargate is Serverless (no EC2 to manage)
• AWS provisions containers for us and assigns them ENI
• Fargate containers are provisioned by the container spec (CPU / RAM)
• Fargate tasks can have IAM Roles to execute actions against AWS

## ECS Other
• ECS does integrate with CloudWatch Logs:
• You need to setup logging at the task definition level
• Each container will have a different log stream
• The EC2 Instance Profile needs to have the correct IAM permissions
• Use IAM Task Roles for your tasks
• Task Placement Strategies: binpack, random, spread
• Service Auto Scaling with target tracking, step scaling, or scheduled 
• Cluster Auto Scaling through Capacity Providers
