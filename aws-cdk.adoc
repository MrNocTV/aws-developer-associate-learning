## AWS Cloud Development Kit

• Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language:
    • JavaScript/TypeScript,Python,Java,and.NET
• Contains high level components called constructs
• The code is “compiled” into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
• You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
    • Great for Lambda functions
    • Great for Docker containers in ECS / EKS

## CDK vs SAM
• SAM:
    • Serverless focused
    • Write your template declaratively in JSON orYAML 
    • Great for quickly getting started with Lambda
    • Leverages CloudFormation
• CDK:
    • All AWS services
    • Write infra in a programming language JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET
    • Leverages CloudFormation

## Amazon Cognito
• We want to give our users an identity so that they can interact with our application.
• Cognito User Pools:
    • Sign in functionality for app users
    • Integrate with API Gateway & Application Load Balancer
• Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identity):
    • Provide AWS credentials to users so they can access AWS resources directly 
    • Integrate with Cognito User Pools as an identity provider
• Cognito Sync:
    • Synchronize data from device to Cognito. 
    • Is deprecated and replaced by AppSync
• Cognito vs IAM: “hundreds of users”, ”mobile users”,“authenticate with SAML”

## Cognito User Pools (CUP) – User Features
• Create a serverless database of user for your web & mobile apps 
• Simple login: Username (or email) / password combination
• Password reset
• Email & Phone Number Verification
• Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
• Federated Identities: users from Facebook, Google, SAML...
• Feature: block users if their credentials are compromised elsewhere 
• Login sends back a JSON Web Token (JWT)

## Cognito User Pools (CUP) - Integrations
• CUP integrates with API Gateway and Application Load Balancer

## Cognito User Pools – Lambda Triggers
• CUP can invoke a Lambda function synchronously on these triggers:

## Cognito User Pools – Hosted Authentication UI
• Cognito has a hosted authentication UI that you can add to your app to handle sign- up and sign-in workflows
• Using the hosted UI, you have a foundation for integration with social logins, OIDC or SAML
• Can customize with a custom logo and custom CSS

## Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identities)
• Get identities for “users” so they obtain temporary AWS credentials
• Your identity pool (e.g identity source) can include:
    • Public Providers (Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple)
    • Users in an Amazon Cognito user pool
    • OpenID Connect Providers & SAML Identity Providers
    • Developer Authenticated Identities (custom login server)
    • Cognito Identity Pools allow for unauthenticated (guest) access
• Users can then access AWS services directly or through API Gateway
    • The IAM policies applied to the credentials are defined in Cognito
    • They can be customized based on the user_id for fine grained control

## Cognito Identity Pools – IAM Roles
• Default IAM roles for authenticated and guest users
• Define rules to choose the role for each user based on the user’s ID 
• You can partition your users’ access using policy variables
• IAM credentials are obtained by Cognito Identity Pools through STS 
• The roles must have a “trust” policy of Cognito Identity Pools

## Cognito User Pools vs Identity Pools
• Cognito User Pools:
    • Database of users for your web and mobile application
    • Allows to federate logins through Public Social, OIDC, SAML...
    • Can customize the hosted UI for authentication (including the logo)] 
    • Has triggers with AWS Lambda during the authentication flow
• Cognito Identity Pools:
    • Obtain AWS credentials for your users
    • Users can login through Public Social, OIDC, SAML & Cognito User Pools 
    • Users can be unauthenticated (guests)
    • Users are mapped to IAM roles & policies, can leverage policy variables
    • CUP + CIP = manage user / password + access AWS services

## Cognito Sync
• Deprecated – use AWS AppSync now
• Store preferences, configuration, state of app
• Cross device synchronization (any platform – iOS, Android, etc...)
• Offline capability (synchronization when back online)
• Store data in datasets (up to 1MB), up to 20 datasets to synchronize 
• Push Sync: silently notify across all devices when identity data changes 
• Cognito Stream: stream data from Cognito into Kinesis
• Cognito Events: execute Lambda functions in response to events

## Step Function - States
• Choice State - Test for a condition to send to a branch (or default branch)
• Fail or Succeed State - Stop execution with failure or success
• Pass State - Simply pass its input to its output or inject some fixed data, without performing work.
• Wait State - Provide a delay for a certain amount of time or until a specified time/date.
• Map State - Dynamically iterate steps.’
• Parallel State - Begin parallel branches of execution.

## Error Handling in Step Functions
• Any state can encounter runtime errors for various reasons:
    • State machine definition issues (for example, no matching rule in a Choice state) 
    • Task failures (for example, an exception in a Lambda function)
    • Transient issues (for example, network partition events)
• Use Retry (to retry failed state) and Catch (transition to failure path) in the State Machine to handle the errors instead of inside the Application Code
• Predefined error codes:
    • States.ALL : matches any error name
    • States.Timeout:Task ran longer thanTimeoutSeconds or no heartbeat received 
    • States.TaskFailed: execution failure
    • States.Permissions: insufficient privileges to execute code
• The state may report is own errors

## Step Functions – Retry (Task or Parallel State)

• Evaluated from top to bottom
• ErrorEquals: match a specific kind of error
• IntervalSeconds: initial delay before retrying
• BackoffRate: multiple the delay after each retry
• MaxAttempts: default to 3, set to 0 for never retried
• *When max attempts are reached, the Catch kicks in*

## Step Functions – Catch (Task or Parallel State)
• Evaluated from top to bottom
• ErrorEquals: match a specific kind of error
• Next: State to send to
• ResultPath - A path that determines what input is sent to the state specified in the Next field.

## Step Function – ResultPath
• Include the error in the input

## Step Functions – Standard vs Express

## AWS AppSync - Overview

• AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL
• GraphQL makes it easy for applications to get exactly the data they need.
• This includes combining data from one or more sources
    • NoSQL data stores, Relational databases, HTTP APIs...
    • Integrates with DynamoDB, Aurora, Elasticsearch & others 
    • Custom sources with AWS Lambda
• Retrieve data in real-time with WebSocket or MQTT on WebSocket
• For mobile apps: local data access & data synchronization
• It all starts with uploading one GraphQL schema

## AppSync – Security
• There are four ways you can authorize applications to interact with your AWS AppSync GraphQL API:
    • API_KEY
    • AWS_IAM: IAM users / roles / cross-account access
    • OPENID_CONNECT: OpenID Connect provider / JSON Web Token
    • AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS
• For custom domain & HTTPS, use CloudFront in front of AppSync
