## AWS Route 53 Overview
• Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
• DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.
• In AWS, the most common records are: • A: hostname to IPv4
• AAAA: hostname to IPv6
• CNAME: hostname to hostname
• Alias: hostname to AWS resource.


- Route53 can use:
• public domain names you own (or buy) application1.mypublicdomain.com
• private domain names that can be resolved by your instances in your VPCs. application1.company.internal
- Route53 has advanced features such as:
• Load balancing (through DNS – also called client load balancing)
• Health checks (although limited...)
• Routing policy: simple, failover, geolocation, latency, weighted, multi value
- You pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone

## Simple Routing Policy
• Maps a hostname to another hostname
• Use when you need to redirect to a single resource
• You can’t attach health checks to simple routing policy
• If multiple values are returned, a random one is chosen by the client

## Weighted Routing Policy
• Control the % of the requests that go to specific endpoint
• Helpful to test 1% of traffic on new app version for example
• Helpful to split traffic between two regions
• Can be associated with Health Checks

## Health Checks
• Have X health checks failed => unhealthy (default 3)
• After X health checks passed => health (default 3)
• Default Health Check Interval: 30s (can set to 10s – higher cost)
• About 15 health checkers will check the endpoint health
• => one request every 2 seconds on average
• Can have HTTP,TCP and HTTPS health checks (no SSL verification) 
• Possibility of integrating the health check with CloudWatch
• Health checks can be linked to Route53 DNS queries!

## Geoproximity Routing Policy
• Route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of users and resources
- Ability to shift more traffic to resources based on the defined bias
- To change the size of the geographic region, specify bias values: 
    • To expand (1 to 99) – more traffic to the resource
    • To shrink (-1 to -99) – less traffic to the resource
- Resources can be:
• AWS resources (specify AWS region)
• Non-AWS resources (specify Latitude and Longitude)
• You must use Route 53 Traffic Flow (advanced) to use this feature

## Multi Value Routing Policy
• Use when routing traffic to multiple resources
• Want to associate a Route 53 health checks with records
• Up to 8 healthy records are returned for each MultiValue query 
• Multi Value is not a substitute for having an ELB

## Route53 as a Registrar
• A domain name registrar is an organization that manages the
reservation of Internet domain names
- Famous names: 
• GoDaddy
• Google Domains 
• Etc...
• And also... Route53 (e.g. AWS)!
• Domain Registrar != DNS

## 3rd Party Registrar with AWS Route 53
• If you buy your domain on 3rd party website, you can still use Route53. 
• 1) Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53
• 2) Update NS Records on 3rd party website to use Route 53 name servers • Domain Registrar != DNS
• (But each domain registrar usually comes with some DNS features)
