## Amazon S3 Overview - Buckets
• Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories) 
• Buckets must have a globally unique name
• Buckets are defined at the region level
• Naming convention
• No uppercase
• No underscore
• 3-63 characters long
• Not an IP
• Must start with lowercase letter or number

• Object values are the content of the body:
• Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
• If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
• Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
• Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle 
• Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

## Amazon S3 - Versioning
• You can version your files in Amazon S3
• It is enabled at the bucket level
• Same key overwrite will increment the “version”: 1, 2, 3....
• It is best practice to version your buckets
• Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version) 
• Easy roll back to previous version
• Notes:
    • Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null” • Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

## S3 Encryption for Objects
• There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3
    • SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
    • SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys 
    • SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
    • Client Side Encryption
• It’s important to understand which ones are adapted to which situation for the exam

### SSE-S3
• SSE-S3: encryption using keys handled & managed by Amazon S3 
• Object is encrypted server side
• AES-256 encryption type
• Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"

### SSE-KMS
• SSE-KMS: encryption using keys handled & managed by KMS
• KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail
• Object is encrypted server side
• Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": ”aws:kms"

### SSE-C
• SSE-C: server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS • Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key you provide
• *HTTPS must be used*
• Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made

### Client Side Encryption
• Client library such as the Amazon S3 Encryption Client
• Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3
• Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3 
• Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle

## Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
• Amazon S3 exposes:
    • HTTP endpoint: non encrypted
    • HTTPS endpoint: encryption in flight
• You’re free to use the endpoint you want, but HTTPS is recommended 
• Most clients would use the HTTPS endpoint by default
• HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C
• Encryption in flight is also called SSL /TLS
 
## S3 Security
• User based
    • IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
• Resource Based
    • Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
    • Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain
    • Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common

• Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
• the user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
• AND there’s no explicit DENY

### S3 Bucket Policies
• JSON based policies
    • Resources: buckets and objects
    • Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
    • Effect: Allow / Deny
    • Principal:The account or user to apply the policy to

• Use S3 bucket for policy to:
    • Grant public access to the bucket
    • Force objects to be encrypted at upload
    • Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

### Bucket settings for Block Public Access
• Block public access to buckets and objects granted through 
    • new access control lists (ACLs)
    • any access control lists (ACLs)
    • new public bucket or access point policies

• Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies
• These settings were created to prevent company data leaks
• If you know your bucket should never be public, leave these on
• Can be set at the account level


## S3 Websites
• S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the www
• The website URL will be:
    • <bucket-name>.s3-website-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com OR
    • <bucket-name>.s3-website.<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
• If you get a 403 (Forbidden) error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!

## CORS - Explained
• An origin is a scheme (protocol), host (domain) and port
    • E.g.: https://www.example.com (implied port is 443 for HTTPS, 80 for HTTP)
• CORS means Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
• Web Browser based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visiting the main origin
• Same origin: http://example.com/app1 & http://example.com/app2
• Different origins: http://www.example.com & http://other.example.com
• The requests won’t be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the requests, using CORS Headers (ex: Access-Control-Allow-Origin)

## S3 CORS
• If a client does a cross-origin request on our S3 bucket, we need to enable the correct CORS headers
• It’s a popular exam question
• You can allow for a specific origin or for * (all origins)

## Amazon S3 - Consistency Model
• Strong consistency as of Dec 2020:
• After a:
    • successful write of a new object (new PUT)
    • or an overwrite or delete of an existing object (overwrite PUT or DELETE)
• ...any:
    • subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object (read after write consistency)
    • subsequent list request immediately reflects changes (list consistency)
• Available at no additional cost, without any performance impact
