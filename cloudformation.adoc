## Infrastructure as Code
• Currently, we have been doing a lot of manual work
• All this manual work will be very tough to reproduce: • In another region
• in another AWS account
• Within the same region if everything was deleted
• Wouldn’t it be great, if all our infrastructure was... code?
• That code would be deployed and create / update / delete our
infrastructure

## What is CloudFormation
• CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
• For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say: 
    • I want a security group
    • I want two EC2 machines using this security group
    • I want two Elastic IPs for these EC2 machines
    • I want an S3 bucket
    • I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
• Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

## Benefits of AWS CloudFormation
• Infrastructure as code
    • No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control 
    • The code can be version controlled for example using git
    • Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code
• Cost
    • Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how
    much a stack costs you
    • You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
    • Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM, safely

• Productivity
    • Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
    • Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
    • Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
• Separation of concern: create many stacks for many apps, and many layers. Ex: 
    • VPC stacks
    • Network stacks 
    • App stacks
• Don’t re-invent the wheel
• Leverage existing templates on the web!
• Leverage the documentation

## How CloudFormation Works
• Templates have to be uploaded in S3 and then referenced in CloudFormation
• To update a template, we can’t edit previous ones. We have to re- upload a new version of the template to AWS
• Stacks are identified by a name
• Deleting a stack deletes every single artifact that was created by
CloudFormation.

## Deploying CloudFormation templates
• Manual way:
    • Editing templates in the CloudFormation Designer 
    • Using the console to input parameters, etc
• Automated way:
    • Editing templates in a YAML file
    • Using the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) to deploy the templates
    • Recommended way when you fully want to automate your flow

## CloudFormation Building Blocks
Templates components (one course section for each):
    1. Resources: your AWS resources declared in the template (MANDATORY)
    2. Parameters: the dynamic inputs for your template
    3. Mappings: the static variables for your template
    4. Outputs: References to what has been created
    5. Conditionals: List of conditions to perform resource creation
    6. Metadata
Templates helpers: 
    1. References
    2. Functions
 
## What are resources?
• Resources are the core of your CloudFormation template (MANDATORY)
• They represent the different AWS Components that will be created and configured
• Resources are declared and can reference each other
• AWS figures out creation, updates and deletes of resources for us
• There are over 224 types of resources (!)
• Resource types identifiers are of the form: *AWS::aws-product-name::data-type-name*

## FAQ for resources
• Can I create a dynamic amount of resources?
>> No, you can’t. Everything in the CloudFormation template has to be declared.You can’t perform code generation there
• Is every AWS Service supported?
>> Almost. Only a select few niches are not there yet
>> You can work around that using AWS Lambda Custom Resources
  
## What are parameters?
• Parameters are a way to provide inputs to your AWS CloudFormation template
• They’re important to know about if:
    • You want to reuse your templates across the company 
    • Some inputs can not be determined ahead of time
• Parameters are extremely powerful, controlled, and can prevent errors from happening in your templates thanks to types.

## When should you use a parameter?
• Ask yourself this:
• Is this CloudFormation resource configuration likely to change in the future? • If so, make it a parameter.
• You won’t have to re-upload a template to change its conten

## How to Reference a Parameter
• The *Fn::Ref* function can be leveraged to reference parameters
• Parameters can be used anywhere in a template.
• The shorthand for this inYAML is *!Ref*
• The function can also reference other elements within the template

## Concept: Pseudo Parameters
• AWS offers us pseudo parameters in any CloudFormation template.
• These can be used at any time and are enabled by default

## What are mappings?
• Mappings are fixed variables within your CloudFormation Template.
• They’re very handy to differentiate between different environments (dev vs prod), regions (AWS regions), AMI types, etc
• All the values are hardcoded within the template

## When would you use mappings vs parameters ?
• Mappings are great *when you know in advance all the values that can be taken and that they can be deduced from variables* such as
    • Region
    • Availability Zone
    • AWS Account
    • Environment (dev vs prod) • Etc...
• They allow safer control over the template.
• *Use parameters when the values are really user specific*

Fn::FindInMap
Accessing Mapping Values
• We use Fn::FindInMap to return a named value from a specific key 
• !FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ]

## What are outputs?
• The Outputs section declares optional outputs values that we can import into other stacks (if you export them first)!
• You can also view the outputs in the AWS Console or in using the AWS CLI
• They’re very useful for example if you define a network CloudFormation, and
output the variables such as VPC ID and your Subnet IDs
• It’s the best way to perform some collaboration cross stack, as you let expert handle their own part of the stack
• *You can’t delete a CloudFormation Stack if its outputs are being referenced by another CloudFormation stack*
- *exportd output name must be unique within your region*

## Cross Stack Reference
• We then create a second template that leverages that security group
• For this, we use the Fn::ImportValue function
• You can’t delete the underlying stack until all the references are deleted too.

## What are conditions used for?
• Conditions are used to control the creation of resources or outputs based on a condition.
• Conditions can be whatever you want them to be, but common ones are:
    • Environment (dev / test / prod) 
    • AWS Region
    • Any parameter value
• Each condition can reference another condition, parameter value or mapping


• The intrinsic function (logical) can be any of the following:
    • Fn::And
    • Fn::Equals
    • Fn::If
    • Fn::Not
    • Fn::Or

## CloudFormation
Must Know Intrinsic Functions
• Ref
• Fn::GetAtt
• Fn::FindInMap
• Fn::ImportValue
• Fn::Join
• Fn::Sub
• Condition Functions (Fn::If, Fn::Not, Fn::Equals, etc...)

## CloudFormation Rollbacks
• Stack Creation Fails:
    • Default: everything rolls back (gets deleted).We can look at the log 
    • Option to disable rollback and troubleshoot what happened

• Stack Update Fails:
    • The stack automatically rolls back to the previous known working state 
    • Ability to see in the log what happened and error messages

## ChangeSets
• When you update a stack, you need to know what changes before it happens for greater confidence
• ChangeSets won’t say if the update will be successful

## Nested stacks
• Nested stacks are stacks as part of other stacks
• They allow you to isolate repeated patterns / common components in separate stacks and call them from other stacks
• Example:
    • Load Balancer configuration that is re-used 
    • Security Group that is re-used
• Nested stacks are considered best practice
• To update a nested stack, always update the parent (root stack)

## CloudFormation – Cross vs Nested Stacks
• Cross Stacks
    • Helpful when stacks have different lifecycles
    • Use Outputs Export and Fn::ImportValue
    • *When you need to pass export values to many stacks (VPC Id, etc...)*
• Nested Stacks
    • Helpful when components must be re-used
    • Ex: re-use how to properly configure an Application Load Balancer
    • *The nested stack only is important to the higher level stack (it’s not shared)*

## CloudFormation - StackSets
• Create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation
• Administrator account to create StackSets
• Trusted accounts to create, update, delete stack instances from StackSets
• When you update a stack set, all associated stack instances are updated throughout all accounts and regions.

## CloudFormation Drift
• CloudFormation allows you to create infrastructure
• But it doesn’t protect you against manual configuration changes
• How do we know if our resources have drifted?
• We can use CloudFormation drift!
• Not all resources are supported yet
