- when you start an instance after stopped it, the public IP v4 address will be changed.

- if your application is not accessible, it's a security group issue.

- if your application gives "connection refused", then it's an application error or it's not launched.

- EC2 instance connect (ssh to ec2 via browser)

- when you first download a file from aws, the permission is 0644 and that's too open.

- ssh -i <pem file> ec2-user@<ec2-public-ipaddress>

- ec2 instance connect still effected by security group, if you remove ssh security group, you will only get a black screen.
