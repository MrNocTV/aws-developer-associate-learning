## Cross-Zone Load Balancing
• Application Load Balancer

    • Always on (can’t be disabled) 
    • No charges for inter AZ data

Network Load Balancer
• Disabled by default
• You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled

Classic Load Balancer
    • Through Console => Enabled by default
    • Through CLI / API => Disabled by default
    • No charges for inter AZ data if enabled

## SSL/TLS
• The load balancer uses an X.509 certificate (SSL/TLS server certificate) • You can manage certificates using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
• You can create upload your own certificates alternatively
• HTTPS listener:
• You must specify a default certificate
• You can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains
• Clients can use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach
• Ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL /TLS (legacy clients)

Note:
• Only works for ALB & NLB (newer generation), CloudFront
• Does not work for CLB (older gen)

## ELB – Connection Draining
• Time to complete “in-flight requests” while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy
• Stops sending new requests to the instance which is de-registering
• Between 1 to 3600 seconds, default is 300 seconds
• Can be disabled (set value to 0)
• Set to a low value if your requests are short

Feature naming:
• CLB:ConnectionDraining
• TargetGroup:DeregistrationDelay
(for ALB & NLB)

## ASGs have the following attributes
• A launch configuration 
    • AMI + InstanceType
    • EC2 User Data 
    • EBSVolumes
    • Security Groups 
    • SSH Key Pair
• Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity 
• Network + Subnets Information
• Load Balancer Information
• Scaling Policies

Auto Scaling Alarms
• It is possible to scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms 
• An Alarm monitors a metric (such as Average CPU)
• Metrics are computed for the overall ASG instances
• Based on the alarm:
    • We can create scale-out policies (increase the number of instances) 
    • We can create scale-in policies (decrease the number of instances)

Auto Scaling Custom Metric
• We can auto scale based on a custom metric (ex: number of connected users)
    • 1. Send custom metric from application on EC2 to CloudWatch (PutMetric API)
    • 2. Create CloudWatch alarm to react to low / high values
    • 3. Use the CloudWatch alarm as the scaling policy for ASG

## ASG Brain Dump
• Scaling policies can be on CPU, Network... and can even be on custom metrics or based on a schedule (if you know your visitors patterns)
• ASGs use Launch configurations or Launch Templates (newer)
• To update an ASG, you must provide a new launch configuration / launch template
• IAM roles attached to an ASG will get assigned to EC2 instances
• ASG are free.You pay for the underlying resources being launched
• Having instances under an ASG means that if they get terminated for whatever reason, the ASG will automatically create new ones as a replacement. Extra safety!
• ASG can terminate instances marked as unhealthy by an LB (and hence replace them)

Auto Scaling Groups - Scaling Cooldowns
- The cool down period helps to ensure that your AutoScaling group doesn't launch or terminate additional instances before the previous scaling activity takes effect.
- Ifthedefaultcooldownperiodof300secondsistoolong—youcanreducecosts by applying a scaling-specific cooldown period of 180 seconds to the scale-in policy.
