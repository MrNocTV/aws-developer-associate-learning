- AWS CodeCommit: storing our code
- AWS CodePipeline: automating our pipeline from code to ElasticBeanstalk
- AWS CodeBuild: building and testing our code
- AWS CodeDeploy: deploying the code to EC2 fleets (not BeanStalk)

## Continuous Integration
• Developers push the code to a code repository often (GitHub / CodeCommit / Bitbucket / etc…)
• A testing / build server checks the code as soon as it’s pushed (CodeBuild / Jenkins CI / etc…)
• The developer gets feedback about the tests and checks that have passed / failed
• Find bugs early, fix bugs
• Deliver faster as the code is tested
• Deploy often
• Happier developers, as they’re unblocked

## Continuous Delivery
• Ensure that the software can be released reliably whenever needed.
• Ensures deployments happen often and are quick
• Shift away from “one release every 3 months” to ”5 releases a day”
• That usually means automated deployment
    • CodeDeploy
    • Jenkins CD
    • Spinnaker
    • Etc… 

## CodeCommit
• Version control is the ability to understand the various changes that happened to the code over time (and possibly roll back).
• All these are enabled by using a version control system such as Git
• A Git repository can live on one’s machine, but it usually lives on a central online repository
• Benefits are:
    • Collaborate with other developers
    • Make sure the code is backed-up somewhere
    • Make sure it’s fully viewable and auditable

### AWS CodeCommit:
• private Git repositories
• No size limit on repositories (scale seamlessly)
• Fully managed, highly available
• Code only in AWS Cloud account => increased security and compliance
• Secure (encrypted, access control, etc…)
• Integrated with Jenkins / CodeBuild / other CI tools

## CodeCommit Security
• Interactions are done using Git (standard)
• Authentication in Git:
    • SSH Keys: AWS Users can configure SSH keys in their IAM Console
    • HTTPS: Done through the AWS CLI Authentication helper or Generating HTTPS credentials
    • MFA (multi factor authentication) can be enabled for extra safety

• Authorization in Git:
    • IAM Policies manage user / roles rights to repositories

• Encryption:
    • Repositories are automatically encrypted at rest using KMS
    • Encrypted in transit (can only use HTTPS or SSH – both secure)

• Cross Account access:
    • Do not share your SSH keys
    • Do not share your AWS credentials
    • Use IAM Role in your AWS Account and use AWS STS (with AssumeRole API)
## CodeCommit vs GitHub
• Security:
    • GitHub: GitHub Users
    • CodeCommit: AWS IAM users & roles,
• Hosted:
    • GitHub: hosted by GitHub
    • GitHub Enterprise: self hosted on your
servers
    • CodeCommit: managed & hosted by AWS
    • UI:
    • GitHub UI is fully featured
    • CodeCommit UI is minimal

## CodeCommit Notifications
• You can trigger notifications in CodeCommit using AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) or AWS Lambda or AWS CloudWatch Event Rules
• Use cases for notifications SNS / AWS Lambda notifications:
    • Deletion of branches
    • Trigger for pushes that happens in master branch
    • Notify external Build System
    • Trigger AWS Lambda function to perform codebase analysis (maybe credentials got
    committed in the code?)
• Use cases for CloudWatch Event Rules:
    • Trigger for pull request updates (created / updated / deleted / commented)
    • Commit comment events
    • CloudWatch Event Rules goes into an SNS topic

## CodePipeline
• Continuous delivery
• Visual workflow
• Source: GitHub / CodeCommit / Amazon S3
• Build: CodeBuild / Jenkins / etc…
• Load Testing: 3rd party tools
• Deploy: AWS CodeDeploy / Beanstalk / CloudFormation / ECS…
• Made of stages:
    • Each stage can have sequential actions and / or parallel actions
    • Stages examples: Build / Test / Deploy / Load Test / etc…
    • Manual approval can be defined at any stage

## AWS CodePipeline Artifacts
• Each pipeline stage can create ”artifacts”
• Artifacts are passed stored in Amazon S3 and passed on to the next
stage

## CodePipeline Troubleshooting
• CodePipeline state changes happen in *AWS CloudWatch Events*, which
can in return create SNS notifications.
    • Ex: you can create events for failed pipelines
    • Ex: you can create events for cancelled stages

• If CodePipeline fails a stage, your pipeline stops and you can get
information in the console
• AWS CloudTrail can be used to audit AWS API calls
• If Pipeline can’t perform an action, make sure the “IAM Service Role” attached does have enough permissions (IAM Policy)


***** Stages have multiple action groups *****

## CodeBuild Overview

• Fully managed build service
• Alternative to other build tools such as Jenkins
• Continuous scaling (no servers to manage or provision – no build queue)
• Pay for usage: the time it takes to complete the builds
• Leverages Docker under the hood for reproducible builds
• Possibility to extend capabilities leveraging our own base Docker images
• Secure: Integration with KMS for encryption of build artifacts, IAM for build permissions, and VPC for network security, CloudTrail for API calls logging

## CodeBuild Overview
• Source Code from GitHub / CodeCommit / CodePipeline / S3…
• Build instructions can be defined in code (buildspec.yml file)
• Output logs to Amazon S3 & AWS CloudWatch Logs
• Metrics to monitor CodeBuild statistics
• Use CloudWatch Events to detect failed builds and trigger notifications
• Use CloudWatch Alarms to notify if you need “thresholds” for failures
• CloudWatch Events / AWS Lambda as a Glue
• SNS notifications
• Ability to reproduce CodeBuild locally to troubleshoot in case of errors
• *Builds can be defined within CodePipeline or CodeBuild itself*

## CodeBuild Support environments 
• Java 
• Ruby 
• Python 
• Go 
• Node.js 
• Android 
• .NET Core 
• PHP 
• Docker: extend any environment you like

## CodeBuild BuildSpec
• *buildspec.yml file must be at the root of your code*
• Define environment variables:
• Plaintext variables
• Secure secrets: use SSM Parameter store
    • Phases (specify commands to run):
    • Install: install dependencies you may need for your build
    • Pre build: final commands to execute before build
    • Build: actual build commands
    • Post build: finishing touches (zip output for example)

• Artifacts: What to upload to S3 (encrypted with KMS)
• Cache: Files to cache (usually dependencies) to S3 for future build speedup 

• In case of need of deep troubleshooting beyond logs…
• You can run CodeBuild locally on your desktop (after installing Docker)
• For this, leverage the CodeBuild Agent

## CodeBuild in VPC 
• By default, your CodeBuild containers are launched outside your VPC
• Therefore, by default it cannot access resources in a VPC
• You can specify a VPC configuration: 
    • VPC ID 
    • Subnet IDs 
    • Security Group IDs 
• Then your build can access resources in your VPC (RDS, ElastiCache, EC2, ALB..)
• Use cases: integration tests, data query, internal load balancer

## AWS CodeDeploy 
• We want to deploy our application automatically to many EC2 instances
• These instances are not managed by Elastic Beanstalk
• There are several ways to handle deployments using open source tools (Ansible, Terraform, Chef, Puppet, etc…)
• We can use the managed Service AWS CodeDeploy

## AWS CodeDeploy – Steps to make it work
• Each EC2 Machine (or On Premise machine) must be running the CodeDeploy Agent
• The agent is continuously polling AWS CodeDeploy for work to do
• CodeDeploy sends *appspec.yml* file.
• Application is pulled from GitHub or S3
• EC2 will run the deployment instructions
• CodeDeploy Agent will report of success / failure of deployment on the instance

## AWS CodeDeploy – Other
• EC2 instances are grouped by deployment group (dev / test / prod)
• Lots of flexibility to define any kind of deployments
• CodeDeploy can be chained into CodePipeline and use artifacts from there
• CodeDeploy can re-use existing setup tools, works with any application, auto scaling integration
• Note: Blue / Green only works with EC2 instances (not on premise)
• Support for AWS Lambda deployments (we’ll see this later)
• CodeDeploy does not provision resources

## AWS CodeDeploy Primary Components
• Application: unique name
• Compute platform: EC2/On-Premise or Lambda
• Deployment configuration: Deployment rules for success / failures
    • EC2/On-Premise: you can specify the minimum number of healthy instances for the deployment.
    • AWS Lambda: specify how traffic is routed to your updated Lambda function versions.
• Deployment group: group of tagged instances (allows to deploy gradually)
• Deployment type: In-place deployment or Blue/green deployment:
• IAM instance profile: need to give EC2 the permissions to pull from S3 / GitHub
• Application Revision: application code + appspec.yml file
• Service role: Role for CodeDeploy to perform what it needs
• Target revision: Target deployment application version

## AWS CodeDeploy AppSpec
• File section: how to source and copy from S3 / GitHub to filesystem
• Hooks: set of instructions to do to deploy the new version (hooks can
have timeouts). The order is:
    • ApplicationStop
    • DownloadBundle
    • BeforeInstall
    • AfterInstall
    • ApplicationStart
    • *ValidateService: really important*

## AWS CodeDeploy Deployment Config
• Configs:
    • One a time: one instance at a time, one instance fails => deployment stops
    • Half at a time: 50%
    • All at once: quick but no healthy host, downtime. Good for dev • Custom: min healthy host = 75%
• Failures:
    • Instances stay in “failed state”
    • New deployments will first be deployed to “failed state” instances
    • To rollback: redeploy old deployment or enable automated rollback for failures
• DeploymentTargets:
    • Set of EC2 instances with tags
    • Directly to an ASG
    • Mix of ASG / Tags so you can build deployment segments
    • Customization in scripts with DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_NAME environment variables

## CodeDeploy to EC2
• Define how to deploy the application using *appspec.yml* + deployment strategy
• Will do in-place update to your fleet of EC2 instances
• Can use hooks to verify the deployment after each deployment phase

## CodeDeploy to ASG
• In place updates:
    • Updates current existing EC2 instances
    • Instances newly created by an ASG will also get automated deployments

• Blue / green deployment:
    • A new auto-scaling group is created (settings are copied)
    • Choose how long to keep the old instances
    • Must be using an ELB

## CodeDeploy - roll backs
• You can specify automated rollback options
• Roll back when a deployment fails
• Roll back when alarm thresholds are met
• Disable rollbacks — Do not perform rollbacks for this deployment.
• *If a roll back happens, CodeDeploy redeploys the last known good revision as a new deployment*.
