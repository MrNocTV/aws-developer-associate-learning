## Server side encryption at rest
• Data is encrypted after being received by the server
• Data is decrypted before being sent
• It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key)
• The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere and the server must have access to it

## Client side encryption
• Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server 
• Data will be decrypted by a receiving client
• The server should not be able to decrypt the data
• Could leverage Envelope Encryption

## AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
• Anytime you hear “encryption” for an AWS service, it’s most likely KMS 
• Easy way to control access to your data, AWS manages keys for us
• Fully integrated with IAM for authorization
• Seamlessly integrated into:
    • Amazon EBS: encrypt volumes
    • Amazon S3: Server side encryption of objects 
    • Amazon Redshift: encryption of data
    • Amazon RDS: encryption of data
    • Amazon SSM: Parameter store
    • Etc...
• But you can also use the CLI / 

## KMS – Customer Master Key (CMK)Types
• Symmetric (AES-256 keys)
    • First offering of KMS, single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
    • AWS services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs
    • *Necessary for envelope encryption*   
    • You never get access to the Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)
• Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)
    • Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair
    • Used for Encrypt/Decrypt, or Sign/Verify operations
    • The public key is downloadable, but you can’t access the Private Key unencrypted
    • *Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can’t call the KMS *API*

## AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
• Able to fully manage the keys & policies: 
    • Create
    • Rotation policies 
    • Disable
    • Enable
• Able to audit key usage (using CloudTrail)
• *Three types of Customer Master Keys (CMK)*:
    • AWS Managed Service Default CMK: free
    • User Keys created in KMS: $1 / month
    • User Keys imported (must be 256-bit symmetric key): $1 / month
• + pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)

## AWS KMS 101
• Anytime you need to share sensitive information... use KMS 
    • Database passwords
    • Credentials to external service 
    • Private Key of SSL certificates
• The value in KMS is that the CMK used to encrypt data can never be retrieved by the user, and the CMK can be rotated for extra security
• Never ever store your secrets in plaintext, especially in your code!
• Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables
• KMS can only help in encrypting up to 4K
• *If data > 4 KB, use envelope encryption*

• To give access to KMS to someone:
    • Make sure the Key Policy allows the user
    • Make sure the IAM Policy allows the API calls

- *Because KMS key is region specific, when you copy snapshots of EBS volumes accross regions, you need to reencrypt it with another kms key*

## KMS Key Policies
• Control access to KMS keys, “similar” to S3 bucket policies
• Difference: you cannot control access without them
• Default KMS Key Policy:
    • Created if you don’t provide a specific KMS Key Policy
    • Complete access to the key to the root user = entire AWS account 
    • Gives access to the IAM policies to the KMS key
• Custom KMS Key Policy:
    • Define users, roles that can access the KMS key
    • Define who can administer the key
    • *Useful for cross-account access of your KMS *key*

## Copying Snapshots across accounts
1. Create a Snapshot, encr ypted with your own CMK
2. *Attach a KMS Key Policy to authorize cross-account access*
3. Share the encr ypted snapshot
4. (in target) Create a copy of the Snapshot, encrypt it with a KMS Key in your account
5. Create a volume from the snapshot

## API – Encrypt and Decrypt
Envelope Encryption
• KMS Encrypt API call has a limit of 4 KB
• If you want to encrypt >4 KB, we need to use Envelope Encryption
• The main API that will help us is the *GenerateDataKey* API
• For the exam: anything over 4 KB of data that needs to be encrypted must use the Envelope Encryption == *GenerateDataKey API*

## Encryption SDK
• The AWS Encryption SDK implemented Envelope Encryption for us
• The Encryption SDK also exists as a CLI tool we can install
• Implementations for Java, Python, C, JavaScript

• Feature - Data Key Caching:
    • re-use data keys instead of creating new ones for each encryption
    • Helps with reducing the number of calls to KMS with a security trade-off
    • Use LocalCryptoMaterialsCache (max age, max bytes, max number of messages)

## KMS Symmetric – API Summary
• Encrypt: encrypt up to 4 KB of data through KMS
• GenerateDataKey: generates a unique symmetric data key (DEK) 
    • returns a plaintext copy of the data key
    • AND a copy that is encrypted under the CMK that you specify
• GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext:
    • Generate a DEK to use at some point (not immediately)
    • DEK that is encrypted under the CMK that you specify (must use Decrypt later)
• Decrypt: decrypt up to 4 KB of data (including Data Encryption Keys) 
• GenerateRandom: Returns a random byte string

## KMS Request Quotas
• When you exceed a request quota, you get a ThrottlingException:
• To respond, use exponential backoff (backoff and retry)
• For cryptographic operations, they share a quota
• This includes requests made by AWS on your behalf (ex: SSE-KMS)
• For GenerateDataKey, consider using DEK caching from the Encryption SDK • You can request a Request Quotas increase through API or AWS support

## S3 Encryption for Objects
• There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3
    • SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
    • SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys 
    • SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
    • Client Side Encryption
• It’s important to understand which ones are adapted to which situation for the exam

## SSE-KMS
• SSE-KMS: encryption using keys handled & managed by KMS
• KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail
• Object is encrypted server side
• Must set header: *“x-amz-server-side-encryption": ”aws:kms"*

## SSE-KMS Deep Dive
• SSE-KMS leverages the GenerateDataKey & Decrypt KMS API calls 
• These KMS API calls will show up in CloudTrail, helpful for logging
To perform SSE-KMS, you need:
    • A KMS Key Policy that authorizes the user / role
    • An IAM policy that authorizes access to KMS 
    • Otherwise you will get an access denied error
S3 calls to KMS for SSE-KMS count against your KMS limits 
    • If throttling, try exponential backoff
    • If throttling, you can request an increase in KMS limits 
    • The service throttling is KMS, not Amazon S3

## S3 Bucket Policies – Force SSL
• To force SSL, create an S3 bucket policy with a DENY on the condition *aws:SecureTransport = false*
• Note: Using an allow on aws:SecureTransport = true would allow anonymous GetObject if using SSL

## S3 Bucket Policy – Force Encryption of SSE-KMS
1. Deny incorrect encryption header: make sure it includes aws:kms (== SSE-KMS)
2. Deny no encryption header to ensure objects are not uploaded un-encrypted
• Note: could swap 2) for S3 default encryption of SSE-KMS

## S3 Bucket Key for SSE-KMS encryption
• New setting to decrease...
    • Number of API calls made to KMS from S3 by 99%
    • Costs of overall KMS encryption with Amazon S3 by 99%
• This leverages data keys
    • A “S3 bucket key” is generated
    • That key is used to encrypt KMS objects with new data keys
• You will see *less KMS CloudTrail events in CloudTrail*

## SSM Parameter Store
• Secure storage for configuration and secrets 
• Optional Seamless Encryption using KMS
• Serverless, scalable, durable, easy SDK
• Version tracking of configurations / secrets
• Configuration management using path & IAM 
• Notifications with CloudWatch Events
• Integration with CloudFormation
