## Developer problems on AWS
• Managing infrastructure
• Deploying Code
• Configuring all the databases, load balancers, etc • Scaling concerns
• Most web apps have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)
• All the developers want is for their code to run!
• Possibly, consistently across different applications and environments

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk Overview
• Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
• It uses all the component’s we’ve seen before: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc...
• But it’s all in one view that’s easy to make sense of!
• We still have full control over the configuration
• Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances

## Elastic Beanstalk
• Managed service
    • Instance configuration / OS is handled by Beanstalk
    • Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Elastic Beanstalk

• Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer

• Three architecture models:
    • Single Instance deployment: good for dev
    • LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications
    • ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers, etc..)

## Elastic Beanstalk
• Elastic Beanstalk has three components 
    • Application
    • Application version: each deployment gets assigned a version 
    • Environmentname(dev,test,prod...):freenaming
• You deploy application versions to environments and can promote application versions to the next environment
• Rollback feature to previous application version
• Full control over lifecycle of environments

## Beanstalk Deployment Options for Updates
• All at once (deploy all in one go) – fastest, but instances aren’t available to serve traffic for a bit (downtime)
• Rolling: update a few instances at a time (bucket), and then move onto the next bucket once the first bucket is healthy
• Rolling with additional batches: like rolling, but spins up new instances to move the batch (so that the old application is still available)
• Immutable: spins up new instances in a new ASG, deploys version to these instances, and then swaps all the instances when everything is healthy

## Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Blue / Green
• Not a “direct feature” of Elastic Beanstalk
• Zero downtime and release facility
• Create a new “stage” environment deploy v2 there
• The new environment (green) can be validated independently and roll back if issues
• Route 53 can be setup using weighted policies to redirect a little bit of traffic to the stage environment
• Using Beanstalk, “swap URLs” when done with the environment test

## Elastic Beanstalk - Traffic Splitting
• CanaryTesting
• New application version is deployed to a temporary ASG with the same capacity
• A small % of traffic is sent to the temporary ASG for a configurable amount of time
• Deployment health is monitored
- If there's a deployment failure, this triggers an automated rollback
- no application downtime
- new instances are migrated from the temporary to the original ASG
- old application version is then terminated

## Elastic Beanstalk CLI
• We can install an additional CLI called the “EB cli” which makes working with Beanstalk from the CLI easier
• Basic commands are: 
    • eb create
    • eb status 
    • eb health 
    • eb events 
    • eb logs
    • eb open
    • eb deploy
    • eb config
    • eb terminate
• It’s helpful for your automated deployment pipelines!

## Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Process
• Describe dependencies (requirements.txt for Python, package.json for Node.js)
• Package code as zip, and describe dependencies 
    • Python: requirements.txt
    • Node.js: package.json
• Console: upload zip file (creates new app version), and then deploy
• CLI: create new app version using CLI (uploads zip), and then deploy
• Elastic Beanstalk will deploy the zip on each EC2 instance, resolve dependencies and start the application

## Beanstalk Lifecycle Policy
• Elastic Beanstalk can store at most 1000 application versions
• If you don’t remove old versions, you won’t be able to deploy anymore
• To phase out old application versions, use a lifecycle policy 
    • Based on time (old versions are removed)
    • Based on space (when you have too many versions)
• Versions that are currently used won’t be deleted
• Option not to delete the source bundle in S3 to prevent data loss

## Elastic Beanstalk Extensions
• A zip file containing our code must be deployed to Elastic Beanstalk
• All the parameters set in the UI can be configured with code using files
• Requirements:
    • in the .ebextensions/ directory in the root of source code
    • YAML / JSON format
    • .config extensions (example: logging.config)
    • Able to modify some default settings using: option_settings
    • Ability to add resources such as RDS, ElastiCache, DynamoDB, etc...
• *Resources managed by .ebextensions get deleted if the environment goes away*

## Elastic Beanstalk Under the Hood
• Under the hood, Elastic Beanstalk relies on CloudFormation
• CloudFormation is used to provision other AWS services
• Use case: you can define CloudFormation resources in your .ebextensions to provision ElastiCache, an S3 bucket, anything you want!

## Elastic Beanstalk Cloning
• Clone an environment with the exact same configuration
• Useful for deploying a “test” version of your application
• All resources and configuration are preserved: 
    • Load Balancer type and configuration
    • RDS database type (but the data is not preserved) 
    • Environment variables
• After cloning an environment, you can change settings

## Elastic Beanstalk Migration: Load Balancer
• After creating an Elastic Beanstalk environment, you cannot change the Elastic Load Balancer type (only the configuration)
• To migrate:
1. create a new environment with the same configuration except LB (can’t clone)
2. deploy your application onto the new environment
3. perform a CNAME swap or Route 53 update

## RDS with Elastic Beanstalk
• RDS can be provisioned with Beanstalk, which is great for dev / test
• This is not great for prod as the database lifecycle is tied to the Beanstalk environment lifecycle
• The best for prod is to separately create an RDS database and provide our EB application with the connection string

## Elastic Beanstalk Migration: Decouple RDS
1. Create a snapshot of RDS DB (as a safeguard)
2. Go to the RDS console and protect the RDS database from deletion
3. Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment, without RDS, point your application to existing RDS
4. perform a CNAME swap (blue/green) or Route 53 update, confirm working
5. Terminate the old environment (RDS won’t be deleted)
6. Delete CloudFormation stack (in DELETE_FAILED state)

## Elastic Beanstalk – Single Docker 
• Run your application as a single docker container
• Either provide:
• Dockerfile: Elastic Beanstalk will build and run the Docker container
• Dockerrun.aws.json (v1): Describe where *already built* Docker image is 
• Image
• Ports
• Volumes 
• Logging 
• Etc...
• *Beanstalk in Single Docker Container does not use ECS*

## Elastic Beanstalk – Multi Docker Container 
• Multi Docker helps run multiple containers per EC2 instance in EB
• This will create for you: 
    • ECS Cluster
    • EC2 instances, configured to use the ECS Cluster 
    • Load Balancer (in high availability mode)
    • Task definitions and execution

• Requires a config Dockerrun.aws.json (v2) at the root of source code 
• Dockerrun.aws.json is used to generate the ECS task definition
• Your Docker images must be pre-built and stored in ECR for example

## Elastic Beanstalk and HTTPS
• Beanstalk with HTTPS
    • Idea: Load the SSL certificate onto the Load Balancer
    • Can be done from the Console (EB console, load balancer configuration)
    • Can be done from the code: .ebextensions/securelistener-alb.config
    • SSL Certificate can be provisioned using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) or CLI • Must configure a security group rule to allow incoming port 443 (HTTPS port)

• Beanstalk redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    • Configure your instances to redirect HTTP to HTTPS: https://github.com/awsdocs/elastic-beanstalk-samples/tree/master/configuration-files/aws- provided/security-configuration/https-redirect
    • OR configure the Application Load Balancer (ALB only) with a rule
    • Make sure health checks are not redirected (so they keep giving 200 OK)

## Web Server vs Worker Environment
• If your application performs tasks that are long to complete, offload these tasks to a dedicated
worker environment
• Decoupling your application into two tiers is common
• Example:processingavideo,generatingazipfile,etc
• You can define periodic tasks in a file cron.yaml

## Elastic Beanstalk – Custom Platform (Advanced)
• Custom Platforms are very advanced, they allow to define from scratch: 
    • The Operating System (OS)
    • Additional Software
    • Scripts that Beanstalk runs on these platforms
• Use case: app language is incompatible with Beanstalk & doesn’t use Docker
• To create your own platform:
    • Define an AMI using Platform.yaml file
    • Build that platform using the Packer software (open source tool to create AMIs)
• Custom Platform vs Custom Image (AMI):
    • Custom Image is to tweak an existing Beanstalk Platform (Python, Node.js, Java...)
    • Custom Platform is to create an entirely new Beanstalk Platform
