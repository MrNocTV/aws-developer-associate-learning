## CloudFront – Origins
S3 bucket
    
    • For distributing files and caching them at the edge
    • Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) 
    • CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)

Custom Origin (HTTP)

• Application Load Balancer
• EC2 instance
• S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
• Any HTTP backend you want


## CloudFront Geo Restriction
• You can restrict who can access your distribution
• Whitelist: Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the countries on a list of approved countries.
• Blacklist: Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on a blacklist of banned countries.
• The “country” is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP database • Use case: Copyright Laws to control access to content

## CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication 
CloudFront:

- Global Edge network
- Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
- *Great for static content that must be available everywhere*

Cross Region Replication:

- Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
- Files are updated in near real-time
- Read only
- *Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions*

## CloudFront Caching
• Cache based on :
    • Headers
    • Session Cookies
    • Query String Parameters

• The cache lives at each CloudFront Edge Location
• You want to maximize the cache hit rate to minimize requests on the origin
• Control the TTL (0 seconds to 1 year), can be set by the origin using the Cache- Control header, Expires header...
• You can invalidate part of the cache using the CreateInvalidation API

## CloudFront and HTTPS
• Viewer Protocol Policy:
    • Redirect HTTP to HTTPS 
    • Or use HTTPS only

• Origin Protocol Policy (HTTP or S3):
    • HTTPS only
    • Or Match Viewer (HTTP => HTTP & HTTPS => HTTPS)

• Note:
    • S3 bucket “websites” don’t suppor t HTTPS

## CloudFront Signed URL / Signed Cookies
• You want to distribute paid shared content to premium users over the world
• To Restrict Viewer Access, we can create a CloudFront Signed URL / Cookie
• How long should the URL be valid for?
• Shared content (movie, music): make it short (a few minutes)
• Private content (private to the user): you can make it last for years
• *Signed URL = access to individual files (one signed URL per file)*
• *Signed Cookies = access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files)*

## CloudFront Signed URL vs S3 Pre-Signed URL

• CloudFront Signed URL:
    • Allow access to a path, no matter the origin
    • Account wide key-pair, only the root can manage it
    • Can filter by IP, path, date, expiration
    • Can leverage caching features

• S3 Pre-Signed URL:
    • Issue a request as the person who pre-signed the URL
    • Uses the IAM key of the signing IAM principal
    • Limited lifetime

## CloudFront Signed URL Process
• Two types of signers:
• Either a trusted key group (recommended)
    • Can leverage APIs to create and rotate keys (and IAM for API security)

• An AWS Account that contains a CloudFront Key Pair
    • Need to manage keys using the root account and the AWS console
    • Not recommended because you shouldn’t use the root account for this
• In your CloudFront distribution, create one or more trusted key groups
• You generate your own public / private key
    • The private key is used by your applications (e.g. EC2) to sign URLs 
    • The public key (uploaded) is used by CloudFront to verify URLs
 

## CloudFront - Pricing
• CloudFront Edge locations are all around the world
• The cost of data out per edge location varies

• You can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction
• Three price classes:
1. Price Class All: all regions – best performance
2. Price Class 200: most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions
3. Price Class 100: only the least expensive regions

## CloudFront – Multiple Origin
• To route to different kind of origins based on the content type

• Based on path pattern: 
• /images/*
• /api/* 
• /*

## CloudFront – Origin Groups
• To increase high-availability and do failover
• Origin Group: one primary and one secondary origin 
• If the primary origin fails, the second one is used

## CloudFront – Field Level Encryption
• Protect user sensitive information through application stack 
• Adds an additional layer of security along with HTTPS
• Sensitive information encrypted at the edge close to user
• Uses asymmetric encryption
• Usage:
• Specify set of fields in POST requests that you want to be encrypted (up to 10 fields) 
• Specify the public key to encrypt them
