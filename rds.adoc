## RDS Backups
• Backups are automatically enabled in RDS
• Automated backups:
    • Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window)
    • Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
    • => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago) 
    • 7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days)
• DB Snapshots:
    • Manually triggered by the user
    • Retention of backup for as long as you want

## RDS – Storage Auto Scaling
• Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
• When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically
• Avoid manually scaling your database storage
• You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (maximum limit for DB storage)
• Automatically modify storage if:
    • Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage 
    • Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
    • 6 hours have passed since last modification
• Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads
• Supports all RDS database engines (MariaDB, MySQL,PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)

## RDS Read Replicas for read scalability
• Up to 5 Read Replicas
• Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region
• Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
• Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
- Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas

## RDS Read Replicas – Network Cost
• In AWS there’s a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another • For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don’t pay that fee

## RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)
SYNC replication
• One DNS name – automatic app failover to standby

• Increase availability
• Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
• No manual intervention in apps
• Not used for scaling
• **Multi-AZ replication is free**
• Note:The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR)

One DNS name – automatic failover
     
## RDS – From Single-AZ to Multi-AZ
• Zero downtime operation (no need to stop the DB)
• Just click on “modify” for the database

## RDS Security - Encryption
- At rest encryption
• Possibility to encrypt the master & read replicas with AWS KMS - AES-256 encryption
• Encryption has to be defined at launch time
• If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
• Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) available for Oracle and SQL Server

- In-flight encryption
• SSL certificates to encrypt data to RDS in flight
• Provide SSL options with trust certificate when connecting to database

- Encrypting RDS backups

• Snapshots of un-encrypted RDS databases are un-encrypted 
• Snapshots of encrypted RDS databases are encrypted
• Can copy a snapshot into an encrypted one

- encrypt an un-encrypted RDS database: 
• Create a snapshot of the un-encrypted database
• Copy the snapshot and enable encryption for the snapshot
• Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot
• Migrate applications to the new database, and delete the old database

- Network Security
• RDS databases are usually deployed within a private subnet, not in a public one
• RDS security works by leveraging security groups (the same concept as for EC2 instances) – it controls which IP / security group can communicate with RDS

- Access Management
• IAM policies help control who can manage AWS RDS (through the RDS API)
• Traditional Username and Password can be used to login into the database
• IAM-based authentication can be used to login into RDS MySQL & PostgreSQL

## RDS - IAM Authentication
• IAM database authentication works with mysql and postgresql
• You don’t need a password, just an authentication token obtained through IAM & RDS API calls
• Auth token has a lifetime of 15 minutes

## Amazon Aurora
• Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
• Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database)
• Aurora is “AWS cloud optimized” and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
• Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 64 TB.
• Aurora can have 15 replicas while MySQL has 5, and the replication process
is faster (sub 10 ms replica lag)
• Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It’s HA (High Availability) native.
• Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) – but is more efficient

## Aurora High Availability and Read Scaling
- 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ:
• 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
• 3 copies out of 6 need for reads
• Self healing with peer-to-peer replication 
• Storage is striped across 100s of volumes

- One Aurora Instance takes writes (master)
• Automated failover for master in less than
30 seconds
• Master + up to 15 Aurora Read Replicas serve reads
• Support for Cross Region Replication


## Features of Aurora
• Automatic fail-over
• Backup and Recovery
• Isolation and security
• Industry compliance
• Push-button scaling
• Automated Patching with Zero Downtime
• Advanced Monitoring
• Routine Maintenance
• Backtrack: restore data at any point of time without using backups

## Aurora Security
• Similar to RDS because uses the same engines
• Encryption at rest using KMS
• Automated backups, snapshots and replicas are also encrypted
• Encryption in flight using SSL (same process as MySQL or Postgres) 
• Possibility to authenticate using IAM token (same method as RDS) 
• You are responsible for protecting the instance with security groups 
• You can’t SSH

## Amazon ElastiCache Overview
• The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases...
• ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached
• Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency
• Helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
• Helps make your application stateless
• AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups
• Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes

## ElastiCache – Cache Security
- All caches in ElastiCache:
• Do not support IAM authentication
• IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security
- Redis AUTH
• You can set a “password/token” when you
create a Redis cluster
• This is an extra level of security for your cache (on top of security groups)
• Support SSL in flight encryption 
- Memcached
• Supports SASL-based authentication (advanced)

## ElastiCache Replication: Cluster Mode Disabled
• One primary node, up to 5 replicas
• Asynchronous Replication
• The primary node is used for read/write • The other nodes are read-only
• One shard, all nodes have all the data
• Guard against data loss if node failure
• Multi-AZ enabled by default for failover • Helpful to scale read performance

## ElastiCache Replication: Cluster Mode Enabled
• Data is partitioned across shards (helpful to scale writes)
• Each shard has a primary and up to 5 replica nodes (same concept as before)
• Multi-AZ capability
