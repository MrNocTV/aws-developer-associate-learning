## AWS STS – Security Token Service

• Allows to grant limited and temporary access to AWS resources (up to 1 hour).
• AssumeRole: Assume roles within your account or cross account
• AssumeRoleWithSAML: return credentials for users logged with SAML
AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
    • return creds for users logged with an IdP (Facebook Login, Google Login, OIDC compatible...) 
    • AWS recommends against using this, and using Cognito Identity Pools 
• GetSessionToken: for MFA, from a user or AWS account root user
• GetFederationToken: obtain temporary creds for a federated user
• GetCallerIdentity: return details about the IAM user or role used in the API call
• DecodeAuthorizationMessage: decode error message when an AWS API is denied

## Using STS to Assume a Role
• Define an IAM Role within your account or cross-account
• Define which principals can access this IAM Role
• Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM Role you have access to (AssumeRole API)
• *Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 1 hour*

## STS with MFA
• Use GetSessionToken from STS
• Appropriate IAM policy using IAM Conditions
• aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent:true
• Reminder, GetSessionToken returns:
    • Access ID
    • Secret Key
    • SessionToken
    • Expiration date

## IAM Best Practices – General
• Never use Root Credentials, enable MFA for Root Account
• Grant Least Privilege
    • Each Group / User / Role should only have the minimum level of permission it needs
    • Never grant a policy with “*” access to a service
    • Monitor API calls made by a user in CloudTrail (especially Denied ones)
• Never ever ever store IAM key credentials on any machine but a personal computer or on-premise server
• On premise server best practice is to call STS to obtain temporary security credentials

## IAM Best Practices – IAM Roles
• EC2 machines should have their own roles
• Lambda functions should have their own roles
• ECS Tasks should have their own roles (ECS_ENABLE_TASK_IAM_ROLE=true)
• CodeBuild should have its own service role
• Create a least-privileged role for any service that requires it
• Create a role per application / lambda function (do not reuse roles)

## IAM Best Practices – Cross Account Access
• Define an IAM Role for another account to access
• Define which accounts can access this IAM Role
• Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM Role you have access to (AssumeRole API)
• Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 1 hour

## IAM Policies & S3 Bucket Policies

• IAM Policies are attached to users, roles, groups
• S3 Bucket Policies are attached to buckets
• When evaluating if an IAM Principal can perform an operation X on a bucket, the union of its assigned IAM Policies and S3 Bucket Policies will be evaluated.

## Inline vs Managed Policies
• AWS Managed Policy 
    • Maintained by AWS
    • Good for power users and administrators
    • Updated in case of new services / new APIs
• Customer Managed Policy
    • Best Practice, re-usable, can be applied to many principals
    • Version Controlled + rollback, central change management
• Inline
    • Strict one-to-one relationship between policy and principal
    • Policy is deleted if you delete the IAM principal

## Granting a User Permissions to Pass a Role to an AWS Service
• To configure many AWS services, you must pass an IAM role to the service (this happens only once during setup)
• The service will later assume the role and perform actions
• Example of passing a role: 
    • To an EC2 instance
    • To a Lambda function
    • To an ECS task
    • To CodePipeline to allow it to invoke other services
• For this, you need the IAM permission *iam:PassRole*
• It often comes with *iam:GetRole* to view the role being passed

## Can a role be passed to any service?
• No: Roles can only be passed to what their trust allows
• A trust policy for the role that allows the service to assume the role

## What is Microsoft Active Directory (AD)?
• Found on any Windows Server with AD Domain Services
• Database of objects: User Accounts, Computers, Printers, File Shares, Security Groups
• Centralized security management, create account, assign permissions
• Objects are organized in trees
• A group of trees is a forest

## AWS Directory Services

• AWS Managed Microsoft AD
    • Create your own AD in AWS, manage users locally, supports MFA
    • Establish “trust” connections with your on-premise AD
• AD Connector
    • Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on-premise AD
    • Users are managed on the on-premise AD
• Simple AD
    • AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
    • Cannot be joined with on-premise AD

## AWS Secrets Manager
• Newer service, meant for storing secrets
• Capability to force rotation of secrets every X days
• Automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses Lambda)
• Integration with Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora) 
• Secrets are encrypted using 

• Mostly meant for RDS integration

## SSM Parameter Store vs Secrets Manager

• Secrets Manager ($$$):
    • Automatic rotation of secrets with AWS Lambda
    • Integration with RDS, Redshift, DocumentDB 
    • KMS encryption is mandatory
    • Can integration with CloudFormation
• SSM Parameter Store ($):
    • Simple API
    • No secret rotation
    • KMS encryption is optional
    • Can integration with CloudFormation
    • Can pull a Secrets Manager secret using the SSM Parameter Store API

## CloudWatch Logs - Encryption
• You can encrypt CloudWatch logs with KMS keys
• Encryption is enabled at the log group level, by associating a CMK with a log group, either when you create the log group or after it exists.
• *You cannot associate a CMK with a log group using the CloudWatch console.*
• You must use the CloudWatch Logs API:
    • associate-kms-key : if the log group already exists
    • create-log-group: if the log group doesn’t exist yet

## CodeBuild Security
• To access resources in your VPC, make sure you specify a VPC configuration for your CodeBuild

• Secrets in CodeBuild:
• Don’t store them as plaintext in environment variables
• Instead...
    • Environment variables can reference parameter store parameters 
    • Environment variables can reference secrets manager secrets
